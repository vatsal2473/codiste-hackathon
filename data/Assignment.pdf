\noindent CHAPTER I 

\noindent REAL VARIABLES 

1. \textbf{Rational numbers}. A fraction \textit{r }= \textit{p/q}, where \textit{p }and \textit{q }are positive or negative integers, is called a \textit{rational number}.  We can suppose 

(i) that \textit{p }and \textit{q }have no common factor, as if they have a common factor we can divide each of them by it, and (ii) that \textit{q }is positive, since 

\noindent \textit{p/}(\textit{$-$q}) = (\textit{$-$p})\textit{/q, }(\textit{$-$p})\textit{/}(\textit{$-$q}) = \textit{p/q. }

\noindent To the rational numbers thus defined we may add the `rational number 0' obtained by taking \textit{p }= 0. 

We assume that the reader is familiar with the ordinary arithmetical rules for the manipulation of rational numbers. The examples which follow demand no knowledge beyond this. 

\textbf{Examples I.} 1. If \textit{r }and \textit{s }are rational numbers, then \textit{r }+ \textit{s}, \textit{r $-$ s}, \textit{rs}, and \textit{r/s }are rational numbers, unless in the last case \textit{s }= 0 (when \textit{r/s }is of course meaningless). 

2. If \textit{$\lambda$}, \textit{m}, and \textit{n }are positive rational numbers, and \textit{m $>$ n}, then \textit{$\lambda$}(\textit{m}${}^{2\ }$\textit{$-$ n}${}^{2}$), 2\textit{$\lambda$mn}, and \textit{$\lambda$}(\textit{m}${}^{2\ }$+ \textit{n}${}^{2}$) are positive rational numbers. Hence show how to determine any number of right-angled triangles the lengths of all of whose sides are rational. 

3. Any terminated decimal represents a rational number whose denominator contains no factors other than 2 or 5. Conversely, any such rational number can be expressed, and in one way only, as a terminated decimal. 

[The general theory of decimals will be considered in Ch. IV.] 

4. The positive rational numbers may be arranged in the form of a simple series as follows: 

\noindent \underbar{}

\noindent \underbar{}

\noindent \underbar{}

\underbar{  }

Show that \textit{p/q }is the [ \underbar{${}^{1}$}${}_{2}$(\textit{p }+ \textit{q $-$ }1)(\textit{p }+ \textit{q $-$ }2) + \textit{q}]th term of the series. [In this series every rational number is repeated indefinitely. Thus 1 occurs as \underbar{${}^{1}$}${}_{1}$,\underbar{${}^{2}$}${}_{2}$,\underbar{${}^{3}$}${}_{3}$\textit{, . . . }. We can of course avoid this by omitting every number which has already occurred in a simpler form, but then the problem of determining the precise position of \textit{p/q }becomes more complicated.] \textit{}
